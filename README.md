An Intelligent Web based Banking Application
Using all or atleast most of the OOP principles studied in class, i was able  to; 

a.	Develop a modern banking web app with a clean, responsive, and intuitive front end.
b.	Enable real time account operations: deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries.
c.	Provide comprehensive transaction history with visual insights (graphs).
d.	Offer downloadable statements (in PDF and Excel formats).
e.	Introduce a seamless user experience that bridges functionality with well looking user interfaces.

So, the system will allow users to:
a.	Create accounts securely
b.	Log in with email
c.	Perform deposits and withdrawals in real time
d.	View current balance
e.	Access a history of all transactions
f.	Visualize their data via charts
g.	Export data for documentation or reporting purposes

My intelligent banking web application isnâ€™t just reusable across multiple domains and clients but built to be adaptable, scalable, and future ready (evolving tech needs as and when). You can rebrand, repurpose, and resell it in academic, commercial, or institutional settings with minimal changes. 
Right now my designed intelligent banking web application has a single user login setup. So, you can add role based access like;
Admin: View dashboards, audit
Customer: Regular operations
Support: Modify locked accounts. 
All by plugging in Flask Login or Flask Security.
